Help

- Make sure there are no spaces in the Blinkit program folder path.

- For Smarthome devices, your device need to run opensource software Tasmota. Device compatibility list: https://templates.blakadder.com/all.html

- For USB sticks it is possible to use a extension cable and or remove/replace the enclosure.

- Instead of a USB stick you could use a USB card reader with status light
